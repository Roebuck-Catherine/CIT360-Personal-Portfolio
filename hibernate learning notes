Hibernate helps streamline the transfer of data between app and database. 

Hibernate is a very large open source Java library. 

Application model classes declared as Hibernate represent database tables. Hibernate class attributes 
match the count and types of the database fields represented. 

When a value in a hibernate class is changed, that change is stored in the database. 

When Java classes are designed to be persisted using Hibernate, the classes need get and set methos compliant with Javabeans. 
The class also needs an attribute that can be an index.
