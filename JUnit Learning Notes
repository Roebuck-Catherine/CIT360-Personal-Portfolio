JUnit is a code testing framework. It runs in most IDE's, is built into Eclipse, and can also be used through the command-line. 

JUnit provides automated testing so that you don't have to spend extra time setting up every test case and condition. 

JUnit tests assertions which can include: 

assertEquals
-asserting that two values are equal

assertTrue / assertFalse
-asserting that two values are true or that they are false

assertNull / assertNotNull
-asserting that an object is null or not null 

assertSame / assertNotSame
-asserting that two objects refer to the same object or to different objects

Timeout Test Example
//put an @Test above each test case

@Test (timeout = 5000)
