Use Case Diagram 

Use Case Diagrams are visual representations of actors interacting with a system. Actors can be people such as users, or they can be 
other applications or systems that have a goal they pursue by interacting with the featured system. 

In Use Case Diagrams, actors are represented as stick figures. Labeled ovals represent use cases (tasks or goals) that actors 
pursue by interacting with the system. Solid lines show association between actors and use cases, sometimes with arrows to indicate 
dependencies between use cases. For example, I sketched a Use Case Diagram depicting some of the use cases for iLearn. One is submitting
assignments, and another is grading assignments. Students submit assignments and instructors grade them. The instructor has nothing to 
grade until a student has submitted an assignment, so an arrow between those two use cases indicates that the Grade Assignments use
case has a dependency on the Submit Assignments use case. 

Use Case Diagrams can be used to identify system requirements and sketch different ways of structuring a system. It is a high level 
planning tool that can be expanded upon with more detailed planning documents.
