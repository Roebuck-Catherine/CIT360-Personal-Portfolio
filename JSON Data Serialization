JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a method for flatteninig data structures into strings 
that can be easily transferred and used to reconstruct or replicate the original data structure.

Even though JSON is derived from JavaScript, JSON data formatting can be used in a lot of 
other programming languages as well. 

JSON reminds me of IKEA furniture. For instance, an IKEA table that is fully assembled is like 
a data structure, and for transport the table can be taken apart and packed flat- table top, legs,
screws. Then it can be reassembled from that flat pack later.
