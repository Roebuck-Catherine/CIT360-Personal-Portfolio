JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a method for flatteninig data structures into strings 
that can be easily transferred and used to reconstruct or replicate the original data structure.

Even though JSON is derived from JavaScript, JSON data formatting can be used in a lot of 
other programming languages as well. For the purposes of this class I'll use it with Java because 
a lot of the other topics for the class are Java topics and I will want to integrate with some of them.

JSON reminds me of IKEA furniture. For instance, an IKEA table that is fully assembled is like 
a data structure, and for transport the table can be taken apart and packed flat- table top, legs,
screws. Then it can be reassembled from that flat pack later. 

For my personal portfolio I am using JSON to serialize my resume data. I wrote a simple console app 
that pulls a few things from my JSON-formatted resume.
