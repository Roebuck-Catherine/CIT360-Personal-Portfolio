MVC is a way of organizing code. The code is organized into 3 folders: Model, View, and Controller. 

There can be multiple files in each folder. Depending on the application, a Model might contain code for communicating with a database, 
or a Model might contain some code for doing calculations. To remember what a Model in MVC does, think of it as representation or model 
of a real world process, like updating information in a database. 

View contains code for an interface- perhaps html for a web page, perhaps some other representation of data, like a graph or a chart. 
Views change to reflect updates in the linked model.

Controller contains logic for communicating between the view and the model. The controller controls the views the user sees and translates 
the ways the user interacts with those views into commands to the mode.
