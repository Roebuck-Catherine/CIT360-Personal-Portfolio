HTTP Url Connections can connect to a webpage. 

One reason I might use this would be if I wanted to pull in info
that changes often. For instance, this link is for a mini weather station
in my neighborhood: https://map.bloomsky.com/weather-stations/eaB1rJytnpS4q52r

Since the weather changes often, maybe I would want to connect to the webpage 
and pull current weather from there.

To open a connection: 

try {
  URL url = new URL("https://map.bloomsky.com/weather-stations/eaB1rJytnpS4q52r");
  URLConnection weatherInfo = url.openConnection();
  weatherInfo.connect();
}
catch (IOException e {
  System.out.println("connection failed");
}
