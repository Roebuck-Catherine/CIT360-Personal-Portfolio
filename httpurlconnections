HTTP Url Connections can connect to a webpage. 

One reason I might use this would be if I wanted to pull in info
that changes often. For instance, I might want to pull the current 
info from a wikipedia page: 

Here's my start to using URL connections: 

try {
  URL url = new URL("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)");
  URLConnection hamiltonInfo = url.openConnection();
  connection.setRequestMethod("GET");
  hamiltonInfo.connect();
  reader = new BufferedReader(newInputStreamReader(hamiltonInfo.getInputStream()00;
  stringInfo = new StringBuilder();
  String line = null;
  while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null)
  {
    stringInfo.append(line + "\n");
  }
  return stringInfo.toString();
}
catch (Exception e {
  System.out.println("something went wrong");
  throw e;
}
finally
{
  reader.close();
}
