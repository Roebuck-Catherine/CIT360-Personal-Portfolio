Sockets help computers use TCP to communicate. 

A client creates a socket and reaches out to connect to a server.
Servers use the java.net.ServerSocket class to listen for clients
trying to connect. 
When the connection is received, the server creates a socket and 
the client and server are then able to communicate by reading from 
and writing to the socket. 

Here is a client program connecting to a server using a socket: 

import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class hello
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      String server = args[0];
      int portNumber = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
      try
      {
         System.out.println("Hello, it's me " + server);
         Socket client = new Socket(server, port);
		 + client.getRemoteSocketAddress());
         OutputStream outToServer = client.getOutputStream();
         DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(outToServer);
         out.writeUTF("Hello from the other side"
                      + client.getLocalSocketAddress());
         InputStream inFromServer = client.getInputStream();
         DataInputStream in =
                        new DataInputStream(inFromServer);
         System.out.println("Message from server: " + in.readUTF());
         client.close();
      }catch(IOException e)
      {
         e.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
}

Here's a server program:
